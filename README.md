# jannikh.com
This is the open-source repository for my personal website [jannikh.com](https://jannikh.com), hosted directly by [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The website is created utilizing [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [just-in-time mode](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Folder structure
### Html pages at root level
- [***index.html***](index.html) is the main landing page of this website. It either contains current information with links other important pages or simply redirects to the page that is the most relevant at that time.
- [***404.html***](404.html) is a simple 404 page to catch any URLs that are not represented in this folder structure.
### Navigation sub-directories and URL structure:
Each of these folders contains an index.html (and often nothing else) in order to generate nice URLs for the user when they navigate.
- [***career***](career) contains (or links to) all professional information about me, like projects or a CV (see [jannikh.com/career](https://jannikh.com/career)).
- [***career/projects***](career/projects) is an index of a selection of relevant projects I worked on in the past few years (see [jannikh.com/career/projects](https://jannikh.com/career/projects)). Further subfolders simply contain websites about these projects with more information about each one.
> *(due to ongoing development of this website, the folder / navigation structure is subject to change and might not always be updated in this readme-file straight away)*

### Distinct folders for website creation and hosting:
- [***3d-objects***](3d-objects) contains 3d files used to render the live view of the thanos model on [jannikh.com/career/projects/3d-model](https://jannikh.com/career/projects/3d-model).
- [***build***](build) collects the files generated by tailwind, mainly the [styles.css](build/styles.css) output (which only has relevant css definitions due to [JIT mode](https://tailwindcss.com/)).
- [***download***](download) contains all files offered for download to users on the website, mostly through the [project pages](https://jannikh.com/career/projects).
- [***img***](img) has all the images used for rendering the website.
- [***node_modules***](node_modules) is made up of the npm modules used to build this website, namely tailwind.
- [***src***](src) contains the source files used to generate the websites and css content. This includes a custom [styles.css](src/styles.css) file with tailwind definitions for all websites, as well as parts for the html pages, such as [header](src/header.html) and [footer](src/footer.html), which are dynamically loaded in via javascript.

### Root level files used for website creation and hosting:
- [***CNAME***](CNAME) contains the domain names that host this website, detected by github pages to seamlessly host the site.
- [***execute-tailwind.bat***](execute-tailwind.bat) is a simple batch script to start the tailwind [JIT-compiler](https://tailwindcss.com/) and keep it watching for files changes, thus dynamically regenerating the website automatically.
- [***github-pages-index.md***](github-pages-index.md) is the old *index.md* file of this repository, explaining how github pages works and what tools it offers.
- [***package.json***](package.json) contains the npm configuration settings and tailwind build instructions (e.g. where tailwind finds the source css files and where to put the generated one) (more details in the [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json)).
- [***package-lock.json***](package-lock.json) contains more metadata for npm modules, enabling package dependency management, version control (more details in the [docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-lock-json)).
- [***tailwind-default.config.js***](tailwind-default.config.js) is the complete initial tailwind configuration with all default css attributes and tailwind commands, including colors and styles (used for reference when creating modified styles).
- [***tailwind.config.js***](tailwind.config.js) extends and modifies tailwind's default styles, this contains all manual customization of tailwind defaults.
- ([***readme.md***](readme.md) is this exact readme documentation you are reading right now, explaining the folder and file structure of this repository.)

## Domain jannikh.de
Also have a look at the [repository jannikh.de](https://github.com/jannikh/jannikh.de) which redirects all traffic from the domain [jannikh.de](https://jannikh.de) towards jannikh.com, including a 404 redirect that keeps the rest of the URL path intact.

Redirecting towards specific German translations of this website and all its subpages is a future goal, which will be tackled after the main development of this website in English is finished.
